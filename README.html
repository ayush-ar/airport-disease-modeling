<h1>Airport Flu Modeling</h1>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>A network consisting of airports as nodes and airline routes as edges was 
constructed with data from <a href="http://openflights.org/data">openflights.org</a> as shown in Figure 1.
Nodes without inbound edges were removed.</p>

<p>Two models were created for the investigation of flu-dynamics in air travel,
namely a "simple model" and a complex model. The simple model has 4 rules:</p>

<ol>
<li>One plane leaves on every outbound route every tick and arrives at its 
destination.</li>
<li>One sick plane will completely infect a destination airport.</li>
<li>Routes are directional.</li>
<li>Airports take 5 - 7 ticks to recover.</li>
</ol>

<p>Propagation of the infection accross the network can be seen in the video below</p>

<p>An example SIR plot of this model looks as follows</p>

<p>The complex model follows 6 rules:</p>

<ol>
<li>One plane leaves on each route per hour.</li>
<li>All routes are directional.</li>
<li>Each airport has 10 people per route that can be either susceptible, 
infectious, or recovered.</li>
<li>There is a parameter &beta; for the number of people an infected person can
infect per hour, and a parameter &gamma; for the number of hours required to 
recover from being infectious.</li>
<li>Each plane has 10 passengers, and will travel along its route at a speed of
&mu; over the distance between airports.</li>
<li>An infected individual is only capable of infecting other passengers of a 
plane during the flight.</li>
</ol>

<p>This model's SIR plot is as follows</p>
