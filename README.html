<h1>Airport Flu Modeling</h1>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>Using python and NetworkX, a network consisting of airports as nodes and 
airline routes as edges was constructed with data from 
<a href="http://openflights.org/data">openflights.org</a> as shown in Figure 1.
Nodes without inbound edges were removed. 
<a href="documentation/flu_simulator.html">Documentation</a> on this simulator 
is provided in pydoc form.</p>

<p><img src="documentation/images/world2-cropped.png" alt="world-network" title="Figure 1." /></p>

<p>Here are some figures of merit<p>

<ol>
    <li>Number of edges: 39467</li>
    <li>Number of verticies: 3308</li>
    <li>Diameter: 13 vertices (<i>Longest path between two verticies.</i>)</li>
</ol>


<p>Two models were created for the investigation of flu-dynamics in air travel,
namely a "simple model" and a complex model. The simple model has 4 rules:</p>

<ol>
<li>One plane leaves on every outbound route every tick and arrives at its 
destination.</li>
<li>One sick plane will completely infect a destination airport.</li>
<li>Routes are directional.</li>
<li>Airports take 5 - 7 ticks to recover.</li>
</ol>

<p>Propagation of the infection accross the network can be seen in the video below</p>

<p>An example SIR plot of this model looks as follows</p>

<p><img src="documentation/images/simple.png" alt="simple-model" title="Figure 2." /></p>

<div class=no_show>
    <p>The complex model follows 6 rules:</p>

    <ol>
    <li>One plane leaves on each route per hour.</li>
    <li>All routes are directional.</li>
    <li>Each airport has 10 people per route that can be either susceptible, 
    infectious, or recovered.</li>
    <li>There is a parameter &beta; for the number of people an infected person can
    infect per hour, and a parameter &gamma; for the number of hours required to 
    recover from being infectious.</li>
    <li>Each plane has 10 passengers, and will travel along its route at a speed of
    &mu; over the distance between airports.</li>
    <li>An infected individual is only capable of infecting other passengers of a 
    plane during the flight.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>This model's SIR plot is as follows</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

First, we examined the median SIR response for 343 initial infection sites, each
chosen randomly.

<p><img src="documentation/images/Directed_Median_SIR.png" title="Figure 3." /></p>

From this, we found that an infection through our network required around three
ticks to have a noticable amount of infections. We also found that the infection
peaks around the nine tick mark, and fully disapates in 15 ticks. We then 
decided to test if there was a difference in out network if it behaved as a 
directed network or a undirected network. Using the method described above, we
constructed a median SIR plot for the undireced network.

<p><img src="documentation/images/Undirected_Median_SIR.png" title="Figure 4." /></p>

As you can see, the two plots are nearly identical, suggesting that due to the
reciprical routes of the network, the directed network behaves similarly to 
undirected form of the network. We decided to test this idea further by running
a series of quaratine efforts based on betweenness centrality for both the
directed and undirected networks, and performed a Kruskal-Wallis test on the 
data collected.

<p>We then examined the effect of the closures on the structure of the network.
Component plots were generated for increasing efforts in a betweenness-based
quarantine effort.</p>
