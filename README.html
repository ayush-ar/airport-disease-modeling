<h1>Airport Flu Modeling</h1>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>Using python and NetworkX, a network consisting of airports as nodes and 
airline routes as edges was constructed with data from 
<a href="http://openflights.org/data">openflights.org</a> as shown in Figure 1.
Nodes without inbound edges were removed. 
<a href="documentation/flu_simulator.html">Documentation</a> on this simulator 
is provided in pydoc form.</p>

<p><img src="documentation/images/world2-cropped.png" alt="world-network" title="Figure 1." /></p>

<p>Here are some figures of merit<p>

<ol>
    <li>Number of edges: 39467</li>
    <li>Number of verticies: 3308</li>
    <li>Diameter: 13 vertices (<i>Longest path between two verticies.</i>)</li>
</ol>


<p>Two models were created for the investigation of flu-dynamics in air travel,
namely a "simple model" and a complex model. The simple model has 4 rules:</p>

<ol>
<li>One plane leaves on every outbound route every tick and arrives at its 
destination.</li>
<li>One sick plane will completely infect a destination airport.</li>
<li>Routes are directional.</li>
<li>Airports take 5 - 7 ticks to recover.</li>
</ol>

<p>Propagation of the infection accross the network can be seen in the video below</p>

<p>An example SIR plot of this model looks as follows</p>

    <p>The complex model follows 6 rules:</p>

    <ol>
    <li>One plane leaves on each route per hour.</li>
    <li>All routes are directional.</li>
    <li>Each airport has 10 people per route that can be either susceptible, 
    infectious, or recovered.</li>
    <li>There is a parameter &beta; for the number of people an infected person can
    infect per hour, and a parameter &gamma; for the number of hours required to 
    recover from being infectious.</li>
    <li>Each plane has 10 passengers, and will travel along its route at a speed of
    &mu; over the distance between airports.</li>
    <li>An infected individual is only capable of infecting other passengers of a 
    plane during the flight.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>This model's SIR plot is as follows</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

First, we tested quarantine strategies such as quarantining  randomly,
in decending degree, and in order of decending betweenness centrality.
